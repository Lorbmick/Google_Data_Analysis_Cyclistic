The following case study is the final portion of the [Google Analytics Certificiate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). The objective is to take what you have learned from the certificate course and perfrom data analysis on a selected case case. I have chosen to analyze the Cyclistic case study. In this case study, I am junior data analyst on the marketing team for a bike sharing company called Cyclistc in Chicago.
